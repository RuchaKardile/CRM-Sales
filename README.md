# CRM-Sales

## Introduction
In the dynamic world of sales, data-driven decision-making is crucial for optimizing performance and achieving business objectives. By leveraging the power of both SQL for analysis and Python for deeper insights and visualization, organizations can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and team performance. In this project, I explore a fictional CRM (Customer Relationship Management) dataset, applying SQL for querying and analyzing data, alongside Python for advanced analysis and visualization, to uncover patterns, forecast outcomes, and ultimately improve sales strategies.

## Ask
How can we use SQL and Python together to effectively analyze sales data, identify key drivers of performance, and provide actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies?

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the combined use of SQL and Python for sales analytics by:

* Using SQL to analyze data efficiently and generate insights.
* Cleaning and preparing the dataset using Python for further analysis.
* Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python to identify trends and patterns
* Conducting advanced analysis by joining multiple dataframes and deriving deeper insights.
* Visualizing the results using Python to present findings in a clear and actionable manner
